# AI Prompt for Event Poster Data Extraction

## Task
Extract all event information from this poster image and return it as structured JSON data.

## Instructions
Analyze the poster carefully and extract ALL available event information. If certain fields are not visible or clear, mark them as null rather than guessing.

- If date shows "Every Tuesday", note in additionalInfo and use next occurrence

### Venue Information

### Categories (use one of these)
- Concert
- Workshop

### Price
- Keep original format shown on poster
- "Free" for no-cost events
- Include all pricing tiers if shown (e.g., "$20 advance, $25 door")

### Missing Information
