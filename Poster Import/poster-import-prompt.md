# AI Prompt for Event Poster Data Extraction

## Field Guidelines

### Dates and Times
- Extract dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Use 24-hour time format (HH:MM)
- If only month/day shown, assume current or next year based on context
- If time shows "7 PM" convert to "19:00"
- If date shows "Every Tuesday", note in additionalInfo and use next occurrence

### Occurrence Types and Series Events
**When the poster shows MULTIPLE specific dates** (e.g., "Oct 31, Nov 1, Nov 2" or "Friday-Sunday"):
- Set `occurrenceType: "recurring"`
- Set `recurrenceType: "custom"`
- Include ALL dates in `seriesDates` array with full start/end datetimes
- Set `startDate` and `startTime` to the FIRST occurrence
- Set `endDate` and `endTime` to match the FIRST occurrence (not the last)

**Occurrence Type Options:**
- `single` - Single day event (default)
- `multi_day` - Multi-day event (same continuous event, like a 3-day conference)
- `recurring` - Multiple separate occurrences (like a fair running 3 different days)
- `all_day` - All-day event with no specific times
- `virtual` - Online/virtual event

**Recurrence Type Options:**
- `none` - Does not repeat (default for single events)
- `custom` - Specific dates listed (use for irregular patterns)
- `daily` - Repeats daily
- `weekly` - Repeats weekly
- `monthly` - Repeats monthly
- `yearly` - Repeats yearly

**Series Dates Format:**
- Each entry in `seriesDates` should have ISO 8601 datetime format
- Include timezone in datetime (e.g., "2025-10-31T10:00:00-07:00")
- If end time not specified, calculate reasonable duration or set same as start

### Venue Information
- Extract complete venue name (e.g., "Prince George Civic Centre")
- Include full address if visible
- Default to city shown on poster or organization location

### Categories (use one of these)
- Concert
- Workshop
- Festival
- Sports
- Theatre
- Comedy
- Conference
- Community
- Education
- Fundraiser
- Market
- Exhibition
- Other

### Price
- Keep original format shown on poster
- "Free" for no-cost events
- Include all pricing tiers if shown (e.g., "$20 advance, $25 door")

### Missing Information
- Set field to null if not present
- Don't invent or guess information
- Note any ambiguities in extractionConfidence.notes
