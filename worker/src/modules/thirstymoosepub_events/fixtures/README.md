# Test Fixtures

This directory contains HTML snapshots for testing the Thirsty Moose Pub events scraper.

## Note

The original URL provided (https://www.nugss.ca/thirstymoosepub-events-) does not resolve.
Once the correct URL is verified, HTML fixtures should be captured here for regression testing.

## Usage

1. Visit the actual events page once the correct URL is identified
2. Save the HTML source to this directory (e.g., `calendar.html`, `event-detail.html`)
3. Update tests to use these fixtures for fast, offline testing
4. Keep fixtures updated when the website structure changes
